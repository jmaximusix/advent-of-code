# Advent of Code 2023
My solutions for this year's Advent of Code. Not trying to be competitve.
I'm here to have fun and improve my knowledge of Haskell along the way.
Although I'm trying to solve the puzzles as elegantly as possible, most of my solutions won't be optimal and I most likely won't update my solution to something better if I didn't come up with it, there's no point.
